    <h2>Microhydropower</h2>
    <h4>Basic information:</h4>
    <p>Microhydropower is a renewable energy technology that generates electricity from flowing water,
        typically utilizing small-scale hydroelectric systems. It harnesses the kinetic energy of water in streams or
        rivers to drive a turbine connected to a generator, producing electricity. Microhydropower systems are often
        used to power remote homes, farms, or small communities, offering a reliable and environmentally friendly source
        of energy. </p>

    <h4>Cost:</h4>
    <p>The cost of installing a micro-hydropower system for your home can vary based on several factors.
        On average, micro-hydropower systems cost between $1,500 to $4,000 per kilowatt of installed capacity.
        However, prices can vary widely depending on your specific site conditions, equipment and materials, labor,
        inspection fees,
        location/terrain, height difference, distribution cost, and environmental impact assessment. Overall, it can
        range from $5,000
        to $50,000 depending on the above factors. </p>

    <h4>Tax rebate information:</h4>
    <p>
        Homeowners considering microhydropower systems may qualify for tax rebates to offset installation costs. In the
        United States, the federal government offers a tax credit of up to 30% of the total system cost, with no maximum
        limit. For instance, if the installation costs $20,000, the homeowner could receive up to $6,000 in tax credits.
        Additionally, certain states provide their own incentives, further reducing the financial burden of implementing
        renewable energy solutions like microhydropower. It's essential for homeowners to research local regulations and
        consult with tax professionals to fully understand eligibility and potential rebate amounts in their area.
    </p>

    <h4>Practices:</h4>
    <p>
        Maintaining and effectively utilizing a microhydropower system at home requires regular attention and care.
        Firstly, ensure the system is installed correctly by professionals and that all components are in good working
        condition. Regularly inspect the turbine, penstock, and other parts for any signs of damage or wear, and
        promptly address any issues to prevent further complications. Keep the intake screen clear of debris to maintain
        optimal water flow and turbine efficiency. Additionally, monitor energy output regularly to ensure the system is
        performing as expected. During periods of heavy rain or snowmelt, be mindful of potential overflow and adjust
        system settings accordingly. Lastly, follow manufacturer recommendations for periodic maintenance tasks such as
        lubrication and system checks to prolong the lifespan of your microhydropower system and maximize its
        energy-generating potential.</p>
