    <h2>Solar Energy Systems</h2>
    <h4>Basic information</h4>
    <p>Home solar energy systems utilize photovoltaic cells within solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity,
        providing a renewable energy source for residential use. By reducing reliance on traditional grid power,
        homeowners can lower energy bills and minimize their carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable
        future.
        Solar panels work by harnessing the photovoltaic effect, which is the process through which certain materials
        generate electricity when exposed to sunlight. Each solar panel consists of multiple photovoltaic cells made of
        semiconductor materials, typically silicon. When sunlight strikes these cells, it excites the electrons within
        the semiconductor material, creating an electric current. This current is then captured and converted into
        usable electricity through an inverter, which transforms it from direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC)
        suitable for powering household appliances and devices.</p>

    <h4>Affordability and Cost</h4>
    <p>The affordability of solar panels has significantly improved due to technological advancements and reduced
        production costs. The total cost of installing solar panels varies based on factors such as system size and
        location. On average, residential solar panel systems in the United States range from $10,000 to $30,000
        upfront. However, with financing options like solar leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs), homeowners can
        often offset a substantial portion of the initial investment, making solar energy a more accessible and
        cost-effective option for many households. Additionally, the long-term savings on electricity bills contribute
        to the economic benefits of investing in solar panels. </p>
    <h4>Tax rebates</h4>
    <p>Rebates in the form of tax credits are available to home owners that can lower the cost of implementing battery storage technology
        up to 30% as outlined below:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2020.</li>
      
          <li>26% for property placed in service after December 31, 2019, and before January 1, 2022.</li>
      
          <li>30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2033.</li>
      
          <li>26% for property placed in service after December 31, 2032, and before January 1, 2034.</li>
      
          <li>22% for property placed in service after December 31, 2033, and before January 1, 2035.</i>
      </ol>

    <h4>Solar panels in practice</h4>
    <p>Solar panels generally require minimal maintenance to ensure optimal performance and longevity. Regular cleaning
        to remove dust, dirt, and debris helps maximize sunlight absorption and energy production. This can be done with
        a soft brush or sponge and mild detergent, or simply with water and a squeegee. Additionally, inspecting panels
        periodically for damage or signs of wear, such as cracks or loose connections, ensures any issues are addressed
        promptly. While solar panels are durable and have no moving parts, occasional maintenance may be needed for
        other components of the system, such as inverters or batteries, depending on the system setup. Overall, with
        proper care and occasional checks, solar panels can provide reliable and sustainable energy for many years with
        minimal hassle or expense.</p>
