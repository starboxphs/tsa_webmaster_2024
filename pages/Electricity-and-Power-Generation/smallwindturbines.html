    <h2>Small Wind Turbines</h2>
    <h4>Basic information</h4>
    <p>Small wind turbines, also known as micro wind turbines or urban wind turbines, are compact devices that generate
        electricity for small-scale use.
        Unlike the large turbines found in wind farms, these home turbines are much smaller.
        They typically have a blade diameter up to 10 meters wide, making them suitable for residential, portable, or
        off-grid applications12.
        These small wind turbines are most commonly installed on rooftops or in open areas with sufficient wind
        resources.</p>

    <h4>Cost</h4>
    <p>The cost of installing a home wind turbine can vary significantly. On average, it ranges between $300 and
        $75,000.
        Factors influencing the total cost include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turbine Type, Size, and Capacity: Different types of turbines (such as roof-mounted or freestanding) come
            with varying costs.
        </li>

        <li>Wind Speed Requirements: The local wind conditions affect the efficiency of the turbine.</li>

        <li>Installation Location: Rooftop or ground-based installation.</li>

        <li>Labor Costs: Hiring professionals ensures safe and compliant installation.</li>

        <li>Ongoing Maintenance Costs: Regular maintenance is essential for optimal performance.</li>

        <li>Available Tax Credits: Some regions offer incentives for renewable energy installations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tax rebate information</h4>
    <p>Rebates in the form of tax credits are available to homeowners that can lower the cost of implementing battery
        storage technology
        up to 30% as outlined below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2020.</li>

        <li>26% for property placed in service after December 31, 2019, and before January 1, 2022.</li>

        <li>30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2033.</li>

        <li>26% for property placed in service after December 31, 2032, and before January 1, 2034.</li>

        <li>22% for property placed in service after December 31, 2033, and before January 1, 2035.</li>
    </ol>


    <h4>Practices</h4>
    <p>Maintaining and utilizing small wind turbine systems effectively requires proactive care and attention. Regularly
        inspect the turbine blades, tower, and electrical connections for any signs of damage or wear, and promptly
        address any issues to ensure optimal performance and safety. Keep the area around the turbine clear of obstacles
        to minimize turbulence and maximize wind capture. Additionally, monitor energy output regularly to ensure the
        system is generating as expected. During periods of high winds, be prepared to adjust the turbine's settings to
        prevent overloading or damage. Follow manufacturer guidelines for routine maintenance tasks such as lubrication
        and system checks to prolong the lifespan of your small wind turbine system and maximize its energy-generating
        potential. Regularly consult with professionals or resources to stay informed about advancements in small wind
        turbine technology and best practices for maintenance and usage.
