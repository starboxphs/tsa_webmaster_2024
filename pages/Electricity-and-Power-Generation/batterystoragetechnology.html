    <h2>Battery Storage Technology</h2>
    <p>Basic information: Optimizing your home's storage system enhances the efficiency of energy generated by solar
        panels, guaranteeing uninterrupted power even during inclement weather. By reducing reliance on the grid and
        storing surplus energy, you secure a steady supply while maximizing the benefits of your solar investment. Plus,
        surplus energy can potentially be sold back to the grid, offering additional financial returns for
        environmentally-conscious homeowners.
    </p>

    <p>Cost:
        While cost is undoubtedly a pivotal consideration for any home upgrade, it fluctuates based on your existing
        installations. For a comprehensive setup including solar panels and a battery, prices typically span between
        $25,000 to $35,000, whereas opting solely for a battery averages between $12,000 to $22,000. </p>
