    <h2>Fuel Cells</h2>

    <h4>Basic information:</h4>
    <p>Fuel cells are devices that convert chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through an electrochemical
        reaction, typically using hydrogen as the fuel source. They offer a clean and efficient way to generate
        electricity, emitting only water and heat as byproducts. Fuel cells are gaining attention in renewable energy
        systems as they can be powered by hydrogen produced from renewable sources such as wind or solar energy.
    </p>

    <h4>Cost:</h4>
    <p>Fuel cell costs have been decreasing steadily due to advancements in manufacturing and materials, with some
        estimates suggesting costs could approach competitiveness with traditional power sources in the coming years.
        Small-scale residential fuel cell systems can range from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, while
        larger industrial or commercial systems can cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.
    </p>

    <h4>Tax rebate information:</h4>
    <p>In the United States, tax incentives for fuel cells include the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which can
        provide a credit of up to 30% of the eligible costs for residential and commercial fuel cell installations.
        Additionally, some states offer their own incentives such as rebates, grants, or tax credits, which can further
        reduce the cost of fuel cell systems. The exact amounts vary depending on factors such as system size,
        efficiency, and local regulations, but rebates can range from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars.
    </p>

    <h4>Practices:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Follow the user manual for startup and operation.</li>
        <li>Check for leaks and inspect components regularly.</li>
        <li>Keep a clean and reliable fuel supply.</li>
        <li> Monitor temperature and coolant levels.</li>
        <li>Use diagnostic tools to track performance.</li>
        <li> Make sure operators are trained and certified.</li>
        <li> By following these steps, you can ensure your fuel cell works efficiently and lasts longer.</li>
    </ul>
