    <h2>Air Source Heat Pumps</h2>
    <p>Basic information: An air-source heat pump can provide efficient heating and cooling for your home. When properly installed, an air-source heat pump can deliver up to three times more heat energy to a home than the electrical energy it consumes. This is possible because a heat pump transfers heat rather than converting it from a fuel like combustion heating systems.
        Air-source heat pumps have been used for many years in nearly all parts of the United States, except in areas that experienced extended periods of subfreezing temperatures. However, in recent years, air-source heat pump technology has advanced so that it now offers a legitimate space heating alternative in colder regions.</p>

    <p>Cost: The cost of installing an air source heat pump depends on the size and brand of the unit, as well as the difficulty of installation 
        any any indoor heating equipment that may be needed. The average instillation cost ranges from $4,000 to $8,000. Some high-brands may cost up to $12,000.</p>

    <p>Tax rebate information: The following tax credit is effective for the product that were purchased and installed between January 1, 2023,
        and December 31, 2032: 30% of project cost up to a maximum of $2,000. </p>
