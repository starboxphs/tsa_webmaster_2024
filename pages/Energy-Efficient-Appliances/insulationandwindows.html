    <h2>Insulation and Windows</h2>
    <h4>Basic information:</h4>
    <p>Insulation refers to materials or techniques used to reduce heat transfer between the interior and exterior of a
        building.
        Energy-efficient insulation aims to minimize heat loss during winter and heat gain during summer, leading to
        reduced energy consumption and costs.
        Windows play a crucial role in a buildingâ€™s comfort, energy bills, and carbon footprint.
        High-performance windows utilize advanced technology to improve energy efficiency and user satisfaction. </p>
    <h4>Cost:</h4>
    <p>The cost of energy-efficient windows varies based on factors such as size, material, and features.
        On average, replacing a window with an Energy Star rating can range from $473 to $3,109 per window.
        Installation and labor costs typically add around $70 to $150 per window.
        Insulation costs range from $1 to $4.50 per square foot installed.
        Factors affecting cost include insulation type, material, and R-value.
        For a 2,000-square-foot house, the average cost can be between $3,000 and $10,000 </p>
    <h4>Tax rebate information:</h4>
    <p>Rebates in the form of tax credits are available to homeowners that can lower the cost of implementing battery
        storage technology
        up to 30% as outlined below:</p>

            Can claim
            up to 30% of project cost - $1,200 maximum amount credited.
        </li>

        <li>(Windows)Effective for products purchased and installed between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2032. Can
            claim
            up to 30% of project cost - $600 maximum amount credited.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Practices:</h4>
    <p> Installing and maintaining energy-efficient insulation and windows is crucial for homeowners looking to improve
        the energy efficiency of their homes. During installation, ensure that insulation is properly fitted in walls,
        ceilings, and floors to minimize heat transfer and maintain a consistent indoor temperature. Opt for
        high-quality windows with double or triple-pane glass and low-emissivity coatings to reduce heat loss in winter
        and heat gain in summer. Regularly inspect insulation for any gaps, cracks, or signs of wear, and seal them
        promptly to prevent energy loss. Similarly, inspect windows for any damage or leaks, and replace
        weatherstripping or caulking as needed to maintain a tight seal. Consider investing in energy-efficient window
        treatments such as shades or blinds to further enhance insulation. By properly installing and maintaining
        energy-efficient insulation and windows, homeowners can significantly reduce their energy consumption, lower
        utility bills, and create a more comfortable living environment all year round!</p>
