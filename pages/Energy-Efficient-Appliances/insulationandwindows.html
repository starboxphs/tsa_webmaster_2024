    <h2>Insulation and Windows</h2>
    <p>Basic information: Insulation refers to materials or techniques used to reduce heat transfer between the interior and exterior of a building.
      Energy-efficient insulation aims to minimize heat loss during winter and heat gain during summer, leading to reduced energy consumption and costs.
      Windows play a crucial role in a buildingâ€™s comfort, energy bills, and carbon footprint.
      High-performance windows utilize advanced technology to improve energy efficiency and user satisfaction. </p>

    <p>Cost:The cost of energy-efficient windows varies based on factors such as size, material, and features.
      On average, replacing a window with an Energy Star rating can range from $473 to $3,109 per window.
      Installation and labor costs typically add around $70 to $150 per window.
      Insulation costs range from $1 to $4.50 per square foot installed.
      Factors affecting cost include insulation type, material, and R-value.
      For a 2,000-square-foot house, the average cost can be between $3,000 and $10,000 </p>
