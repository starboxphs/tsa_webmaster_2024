    <h2>Geothermal Heat Pumps</h2>
    <p>Basic information: GHPs, also known as ground-source heat pumps, can heat, cool, and supply hot water to homes by transferring heat to or from the ground.
      Compared to traditional HVAC units, GHPs are remarkably energy-efficient and can reduce energy bills by up to 65%.
      They achieve this impressive efficiency by tapping into the Earth’s constant underground temperature, which typically ranges from 45°F to 75°F depending on the location.
      There are two different choices when choosing a GHP: A open loop and a closed loop.
     </p>

    <p>Cost: A geothermal heat pump installation typically ranges from $15,000 to $35,000, depending on the system size and loop type.
      Specifically, the cost per ton installed for a geothermal heating system is $4,000 to $8,000.
      GHPs offer significant savings in operating costs compared to conventional heat pumps, running 25% to 65% less. </p>

    <p>Tax rebate information:Rebates in the form of tax credits are available to home owners that can lower the cost of implementing battery storage technology
      up to 30% as outlined below:
    <ol>
        <li>30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2020.</li>
    
        <li>26% for property placed in service after December 31, 2019, and before January 1, 2022.</li>
    
        <li>30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2033.</li>
    
        <li>26% for property placed in service after December 31, 2032, and before January 1, 2034.</li>
    
        <li>22% for property placed in service after December 31, 2033, and before January 1, 2035.</i>
