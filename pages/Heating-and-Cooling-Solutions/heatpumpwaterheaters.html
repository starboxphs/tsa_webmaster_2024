    <h2>Heat Pump Water Heaters</h2>
    <p>Basic Information: Heat pump water heaters use electricity to move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat directly. Therefore, they can be two to three times more energy efficient than conventional electric resistance water heaters. To move the heat, heat pumps work like a refrigerator in reverse.
    While a refrigerator pulls heat from inside a box and sends it into the surrounding room, a stand-alone air-source heat pump water heater pulls heat from the surrounding air and transfers it -- at a higher temperature -- to heat water in a storage tank.
    </p>

    <p>Cost: A heat pump water heater usually costs around $3,600, although costs may dip as low as $1,200 or as high as $6,000 or more. 
        However, itâ€™s important to note that the exact cost of your project hinges entirely on factors specific to your installation, including the system size, installation difficulty, and system efficiency.</p>

    <p>Tax rebate information: The following tax credit is effective for the product that were purchased and installed between January 1, 2023,
        and December 31, 2032: 30% of project cost up to a maximum of $2,000. </p>
