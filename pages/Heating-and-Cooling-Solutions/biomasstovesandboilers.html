    <h2>Biomass Stoves/Boilers</h2>
    <h4>Basic information:</h4>
    <p>Biomass stoves are heating systems that utilize organic materials as fuel to generate heat. These materials can
        include:
        Wood pellets, wood chips, and agricultural waste. Unlike fossil fuel-based boilers, biomass stoves are
        considered a renewable energy source because the organic materials used are derived from plants and can be
        replenished.
        Biomass stoves are commonly used for residential heating, providing warmth to homes and other buildings. Biomass
        boilers are similar to biomass stoves but operate on a larger scale.
        They are furnaces that burn organic materials (such as wood, wood chips, agricultural waste, or even animal
        manure) to generate heat.
        Biomass boilers can be used for heating homes, businesses, other buildings, and electricity generation.
        They are considered renewable energy sources due to their reliance on organic materials. </p>
    <h4>Cost:</h4>
    <p>Biomass stoves and boilers offer homeowners an affordable and environmentally friendly heating option. The cost
        of biomass stoves can range from $2,000 to $5,000, depending on factors such as size, efficiency, and features.
        Installation costs typically add another $500 to $1,500. Biomass boilers, on the other hand, can range from
        $7,000 to $20,000 for the unit itself, with installation costs adding an additional $2,000 to $5,000. While
        these upfront costs may seem significant, biomass fuels like wood pellets or logs are often cheaper than fossil
        fuels, resulting in long-term savings on heating bills. Additionally, homeowners may qualify for incentives or
        rebates from local governments or energy agencies, further reducing the initial investment. With regular
        maintenance and proper fuel management, biomass stoves and boilers can provide affordable and efficient heating
        while reducing carbon emissions.
    </p>

    <p>Tax rebate information: Rebates in the form of tax credits are available to home owners that can lower the cost
        of implementing battery storage technology
        up to 30% as outlined below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Effective for products purchased and installed between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2032. Can claim
            up to 30% of project cost - $2,000 maximum amount credited.
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Practices:</h4>
    <p>
        Installing and maintaining biomass stoves and boilers is essential for homeowners seeking efficient and
        sustainable heating solutions. During installation, it's crucial to consult with professionals to ensure proper
        sizing and placement of the stove or boiler. This includes considerations for ventilation, fuel storage, and
        compliance with local building codes. Regular maintenance is key to ensuring optimal performance and safety.
        This includes cleaning the stove or boiler, chimney, and flue regularly to prevent creosote buildup and ensure
        efficient combustion. Additionally, homeowners should inspect and maintain fuel storage areas to prevent
        moisture and mold growth. It's also important to follow manufacturer guidelines for fuel selection and storage
        to prevent damage to the appliance. By following proper installation and maintenance practices, homeowners can
        enjoy reliable and efficient heating with biomass stoves and boilers while reducing their environmental
        impact.</p>
