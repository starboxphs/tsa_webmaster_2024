    <h2>Biomass Stoves/Boilers</h2>
    <p>Basic information: Biomass stoves are heating systems that utilize organic materials as fuel to generate heat. These materials can include:
      Wood pellets, wood chips, and agricultural waste. Unlike fossil fuel-based boilers, biomass stoves are considered a renewable energy source because the organic materials used are derived from plants and can be replenished.
      Biomass stoves are commonly used for residential heating, providing warmth to homes and other buildings. Biomass boilers are similar to biomass stoves but operate on a larger scale.
      They are furnaces that burn organic materials (such as wood, wood chips, agricultural waste, or even animal manure) to generate heat.
      Biomass boilers can be used for heating homes, businesses, other buildings, and electricity generation. 
      They are considered renewable energy sources due to their reliance on organic materials. </p>
